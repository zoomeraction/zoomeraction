<h2>FPGA</h2>

<p>
  The first time I heard the word FPGA was on the bus on my way to UBC. I met 
  this physics PHD student on the bus who had a mysterious beard, however we 
  started talking and he brought up that for his PhD he and his team build a new
  telescope in Okenagon, BC to measure some sort of astrophysics shifts, I wish I 
  could remember what kind of shift it was. Anyways, the PhD guy explainedf a lot
  of things to me which I only remember FPGA particularly out of them. For me, a computer 
  student, it was borderline embarrasing that I didin't know what FPGAs were, so 
  I obviously became obsessed with FPGAs.

  What the fuck is a FPGA chip?
  Great fucking question! Well, It stands for Field Programmable Gate Array. I know 
  that sound fancy but stick with me. The most important thing that I want you to 
  focus on is the Programmable part. You see developing custom chips for some random
  prototype or passion project is extremely economocly and costly, and you have to deal
  with electrical engineers (ewwww). So what if we had this customizable chip that you
  could program it yourself, instead of going through a whole chip fabrication process.

  Befor we continue and get to the delicious technical details, you might ask where do
  we even use FPGAs? Great fucking question again! You don't see FPGAs around you because
  you are lucky enough to not be an engineer. We use FPGAs for fast growing applications 
  and systems typically. Think 5G, robotics, factory automation, system security, boring 
  stuff.

  Now I want you to focus on the Gate Array in FPGA. I want to say close your eyes and 
  imagine a sea of electric gates but how would you keep reading? Right? This kinds of 
  throwing a bunch of gates give you the flexibility and power to do your
  stuff in parallel because you are not bound by only one core like in like your consumer
  CPUs, yeah I know CPUs have 8 cores nowadays. So typically, the supplier of these FPGA,
  being AMD, Intel, Microchip Technology, or Lattice Semiconductor, give you specialized 
  software so you as a developerp can design the logic you want on the FPGA in two ways,
  either graphical design capture or a hardware description language.

  Ok, I know I just dumped a bunch of what could be labeled as hot bs on you but, you need
  to understand working with FPGAs is such an easy thing to work with that even computer 
  engineering majors can do it!
