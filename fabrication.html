<h2>Fabrication</h2>

<p>I have seen this a lot on Instagram: "How the fuck we went from throwing rocks at each other to turning 
sand to chips. So, I had to figure this out, if another human can know this and breath oxygen, it's probably a 
fair fight to figure it out. I'm not saying it's not complex but you probably can do complex things as
hard as chip fabrication already, somethign with some instruction following, I don't know, have you ever 
baked a cacke? You can compare baking to fabing, maybe? Ok you know what, fuck it we are going to compare 
baking cake to making chips! Hopefully, this comparison gives you enough meta data so you remember 
the process of chip fabrication like making cakes, and if you don't like cakes or this comparison, fuck you.</p>

<p>
  You start baking a cake by preparing the ingredients: 1. flour, 2. baking powder 3. salt 4. butter
  5. sugar 6. eggs 7. vanilla extract 8. milk
  Now for chip fabrication you need: 1. silicon wafers 2. photoresists (positive & negative) 3. dopants () 4. etching chemicals 5. oxidation materials
  6. metallization materials 7. dielectric materials 8. chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) slurries 9. deposition materials 
  10. lithography masks 11. cleaning chemicals 12. protective coatings 13. packaging materials
